# Analysis Plan for RK Shopping Repository

## Objective
To analyze the RK Shopping repository and identify any necessary changes based on the current configuration and documentation.

## Information Gathered
- **Project Overview**: RK_Shopping is an Android e-commerce application built with Kotlin and Java, featuring user authentication, product listing, cart management, and order processing.
- **Technical Stack**: The project uses MVVM architecture, Room for local data storage, Retrofit for networking, and Material Design for UI components.
- **Database Entities**: The application uses a Room database with entities for users, shop items, reviews, and orders.
- **API Endpoints**: The application interacts with a backend API for user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **User Management**: The `UserRepository` handles user authentication and profile management, while the `ShopItemRepository` manages shop items.

## Potential Changes
1. **API Integration**: Ensure that all API endpoints are correctly implemented and tested, especially for user authentication and product management.
2. **Error Handling**: Review and enhance error handling in network calls to provide better user feedback.
3. **Token Management**: Implement secure storage and retrieval of authentication tokens.
4. **Data Synchronization**: Complete the implementation of the `refreshShopItems()` method to fetch items from the API.

## Follow-up Steps
- Review the existing API documentation to ensure all endpoints are covered.
- Test the application to identify any issues with user authentication and product management.
- Implement any necessary changes based on testing results.

## Conclusion
This analysis plan serves as a guide for further development and improvement of the RK_Shopping application.
